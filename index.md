MacroKeyTouchSensor
===============

Week 9 Fritzing and PCB
--------------

### Activities vs Schedule
I am currently slightly behind on the project due to the sensor not being correct on Fritzing's database

### Problem
The main problem is that Fritzing doesn't have the correect sensor in their database MPR121 does exist but it's missing 2 pins.  The one in their GitHub page is also outdated.

Week 8 Basic Breadboard assembly
---------------
### Activities vs the Schedule
As of right now, I'm on schedule with the project.  The component seems to be soldered correct and the Raspberry Pi 3 detected the device.

### Problems
The only problem I experienced today was that I made mistakes with the soldering, where I bridged some of my pins by accident.  This caused me to finish the soldering a lot longer than expected.  Last week, my MPR121 sensor had not arrived, and fell slightly behind with the soldering component.

### Financial Status
The first sensor was bought without paying for express shipping, but I did not expect the shipping dates to have a very wide margin.  Therefore, I ended up buying another sensor and paid for express shipping for it.  It ended up being a waste of money because both of them arrived on Friday, October 19.
